For checking the accuracy of your stereo calibration, I would consider a different approach:

Use the function stereoRectify to get the rectification transformation for the camera. Use the translation and rotation matrices you got from stereoCalibrate.
Perform initUndistortRectifyMap once for each camera. Use
Use the results you got to remap the images from both cameras.
If your calibration went well, the output images should be rectified and undistorted
